### Hi there, I'm Amr Zewail ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a game developer with a medieval fantasy obsession. I learned to code at the age of 11 and have spent most of my life creating
in-engine tools, writing shaders, and bringing exciting game mechanics to life.

I spent most of my career as a freelance programmer with Skylight Games, developing features and maintaining Lyriko, while also
taking on additional freelance contracts and dedicating weekends to personal projects.

Currently working at 2024 Studios as a game developer on exciting upcoming titles such as: Secrets of a Campfire and Project Robot.

## Projects
- **Moths Tweens**: A lightweight C# tweening library focused on speed and zero-GC overhead.
- **Game Engine**: A graphics engine using C++ and OpenGL. Implementing rendering, asset management, and game engine-like architecture for future expansion.
- **Story Outliner**: A visual node graphing tool for outlining branching story elements and character relations.
